# 8_bit_TIMER_Servo
Controlling angle of the servo motor using 8 bit Timer of Microcontroller
Timer 0 of Atmega microcontroller can be used to generate pwm signal to controll the angle of the servo motors. The drawback is that motor can be rotated to only 13 directions
as the resolutions is low but it serves you well when you need timer1 for another applications.
